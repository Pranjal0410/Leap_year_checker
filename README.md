# Leap Year Checker

Welcome to the Leap Year Checker repository! This project is a simple tool that allows users to check whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that contains an additional day, February 29th, making it 366 days long instead of the usual 365.

   ```

3. Run the leap year checker program and enter the desired year to check if it's a leap year:
   ```
